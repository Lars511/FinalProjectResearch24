# Final_Project_Research_24

## General Information
Adjectives are one of the ways a writer draws the reader into the story and enables the readerâ€™s imagination. Past research looked into the difference of adjective usage between male and female novelists, however the experiment was performed on books written after 1960 in English. This research is focused on the adjective usage of two famous books from the 19th century, one male and one female, to see if that relation changed over time. The two books are Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Shelley and Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne. The predicted results are that Mary Shelley used 18 percent more adjectives per 10.000 words than Jules Verne. This shows that despite language development and cultural changes over the past 200 years, the difference of adjective usage between the genders stayed the same. 

## Background Information
Adjectives are used to describe the world around us, especially in literature, since entire new worlds are created. There is previous research done on the differences between female and male writers on the use of adjectives in English,
and it has been determined that female novel writers use more adjectives than male novel writers (Arslan, 2022). There is always a difference in writing style, but it also depends on the type of text. There has been research done on the use of adjectives 
in technical texts and literary texts, and it was concluded that there was a higher frequency of adjectives in technical texts than in literary texts, 67.3% vs 32.7% (Mazdayasna, 2013). On the other hand, research from Argamon et al. (2003), based on the British National Corpus, showed that in fictional texts, male writers tend to use marginally more adjectives. All the previous research was done on books in modern English, but can the same relation be found in books from the 19th century?


## Research Question and Hypothesis

The research question of the project will be: "To what extent do the writers of Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus and Around the World in Eighty Days differ in the use of adjectives?"
The hypothesis will be: "The adjective frequency in Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus is higher than Around the World in Eighty Days."
 

## Method
The two books used will be Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Shelley and Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne. Both books used are downloaded from Project Gutenberg, a free online library which offers thousands of books. The free claws tagger (CLAWS4) from Lancaster University will be used to tag the data, and it will be analysed in Antconc 4.3.1. The adjective frequency will be measured per 10.000 tokens.
