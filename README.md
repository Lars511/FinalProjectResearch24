# Final_Project_Research_24

## General Information
Adjectives are used to describe in detail what is happening in novels to enable the imagination of the reader. In fantasy books entire new phenomena are created, which need to be understood by the reader, while in crime books readers must be able to imagine the crime scene. 
Understanding the adjective use in crime and fantasy books gives an insight how the story gets across to the reader, if the reader is able to imagine all the scenarios in the story. This will be done through the analysis of adjectives used in "Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus" and 
"The Extraordinary Adventures of Arsène Lupin, Gentleman-Burglar". The analysis will be done through part-of-speech selection in the TextBlob python library. The aim is to see how the use of adjectives varies between these two genres and the possible effects. 
## Background Information
Adjectives are used to describe the world around us, especially in literature, since entire new worlds are created. There is previous research done on the differences between female and male writers on the use of adjectives in arabic,
and it has been determined that female novel writers use more adjectives than male novel writers (Arslan, 2022). There is always a difference in writing style, but it also depends on the type of text. There has been research done on the use of adjectives 
in technical texts and literary texts, and it was concluded that there was a higher frequency of adjectives in technical texts than in literary texts, 67.3% vs 32.7% (Mazdayasna, 2013). However, what is the difference in the use of adjectives in literary texts?
The research will investigate on the use of adjectives in two different types of literary texts, looking into a crime book and a fantasy book. It has been determined that in detailed texts, such as technical texts, more adjectives are used, so will that
also been the case for fantasy books, where new phenomena need to be described?

## Research Question and Hypothesis

The research question of the project will be: "To what extent to crime and fantasy books differ in the use of adjectives?".   
The hypothesis will be: "Fantasy writers use a higher percentage of adjectives than crime writers.".   
 

## Method
The fantasy book will be "Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus" written by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley at the beginning of the 19th century. 
The crime book used will be "The Extraordinary Adventures of Arsène Lupin, Gentleman-Burglar" written by Maurice LeBlanc at the beginning of the 20th century. 
Adjectives will be selected through the part-of-speech selecting in the Python library TextBlob, and the percentage use of adjectives will be compared. Both books used collected from Project Gutenberg, a free online library which offers thousands of books.
